This is the documentation and explanation of the code uploaded.
mqttt_get.py is the script to get all the data from the broker server where all the sensors information is being stored.
plotting_data is the script to get live data to analyse the relationship between angle and distance.
plotting_polar is the script to get the polar plot which give better concept visualization for the sensor (the tab continuosly poping out)
